## How Scalar generates GraphQL APIs instantly

Learn how Scalar turns your content models into ready-to-query GraphQL endpoints - no backend setup required.

## The GraphQL Revolution

GraphQL has revolutionized how we build and consume APIs. Unlike REST, GraphQL allows clients to request exactly the data they need, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching problems. However, implementing GraphQL traditionally requires significant backend work - from schema design to resolver implementation.

## Scalar's Zero-Config GraphQL

Scalar's approach eliminates this complexity through automatic GraphQL API generation from your content models. Here's how it works:

### 1. From Content Model to GraphQL Schema

When you define a content model in Scalar, whether through the UI or code-first approach, Scalar automatically:

- Generates a corresponding GraphQL schema
- Creates appropriate types, queries, and mutations
- Handles relationships between content types
- Sets up filtering, pagination, and sorting

### 2. Intelligent Type Mapping

Scalar maps your content fields to appropriate GraphQL types:

| Content Field | GraphQL Type        |
| ------------- | ------------------- |
| Text          | String              |
| Number        | Float or Int        |
| Boolean       | Boolean             |
| Date          | DateTime            |
| Rich Text     | JSON                |
| References    | Custom Object Types |
| Media         | Asset Type          |

### 3. Automatic Resolver Generation

Behind the scenes, Scalar generates optimized resolvers that:

- Efficiently fetch data from the database
- Handle connections between content types
- Implement pagination with cursor-based navigation
- Apply security rules and access control

## Developer Experience

Using Scalar's GraphQL API is straightforward:

```graphql
query {
  blogPosts(
    where: { tags: { contains: "GraphQL" } }
    orderBy: { publishDate: desc }
    first: 10
  ) {
    edges {
      node {
        title
        description
        publishDate
        author {
          name
          image {
            url
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Performance Optimizations

Scalar's GraphQL implementation includes several performance optimizations:

- **DataLoader integration** - Prevents N+1 query problems
- **Query complexity analysis** - Protects against abusive queries
- **Automatic caching** - Reduces database load
- **Query batching** - Consolidates multiple operations

## Beyond Basic Queries

Scalar's GraphQL API supports advanced features:

### Full-Text Search

```graphql
query {
  blogPosts(where: {
    OR: [
      { title: { contains: "GraphQL" } },
      { content: { contains: "GraphQL" } }
    ]
  }) {
    # fields
  }
}
```

### Localization

```graphql
query {
  blogPosts(locale: "fr-FR") {
    title
    description
  }
}
```

### Content Previews

```graphql
query {
  blogPosts(preview: true) {
    # Includes unpublished content
  }
}
```

## Integration with Frontend Frameworks

Scalar's GraphQL API works seamlessly with popular frontend tooling:

- **React** with Apollo Client or React Query
- **Vue** with Vue Apollo
- **Next.js** with built-in data fetching
- **Mobile apps** with Apollo iOS/Android

## Conclusion

By automatically generating GraphQL APIs from your content models, Scalar eliminates a significant development burden. This approach lets teams focus on building features rather than implementing API layers, while still benefiting from GraphQL's flexibility and performance advantages.
