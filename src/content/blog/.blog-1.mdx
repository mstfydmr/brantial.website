## Code-first content modeling

Explore the advantages of code-first schemas and how Scalar brings structure and flexibility to your stack.

## Introduction

In the rapidly evolving landscape of content management, the code-first approach has emerged as a powerful paradigm for defining and managing content structures. Unlike traditional UI-based schema editors, code-first modeling puts developers in their comfort zone - working directly with code to define content models.

## What is Code-First Content Modeling?

Code-first content modeling is an approach where content schemas are defined in code rather than through graphical user interfaces. This approach offers several advantages:

- **Version control integration** - Your content models live alongside your application code
- **Type safety** - Strong typing ensures consistency across your content
- **Developer workflow** - Use familiar tools and processes for schema changes
- **Reduced context switching** - Stay in your code editor rather than jumping between interfaces

## How Scalar Implements the Code-First Approach

Scalar's approach to code-first content modeling emphasizes:

### 1. Type Definitions as Schema

```typescript
type Author = {
  name: string;
  image: Media;
  bio: RichText;
};

type BlogPost = {
  title: string;
  slug: string;
  publishDate: Date;
  author: Reference<Author>;
  content: RichText;
  tags: string[];
};
```

### 2. Automatic API Generation

From your type definitions, Scalar automatically generates:

- GraphQL API endpoints
- REST API endpoints
- Admin UI forms
- Validation logic

### 3. Schema Evolution

As your application evolves, your content models can evolve with it:

- Add new fields without breaking existing content
- Migrate data between schema versions
- Deploy schema changes alongside code changes

## Benefits for Different Teams

### For Developers

- Work in familiar environments
- Maintain consistency through type safety
- Test schema changes with standard tools
- Generate documentation automatically

### For Content Teams

- Structured content enforces quality standards
- Predictable content models enable automation
- Powerful querying capabilities
- Reduced dependency on development for content structure changes

## Getting Started with Code-First Modeling

To start implementing code-first content modeling with Scalar:

1. Define your content types in TypeScript
2. Import the Scalar SDK
3. Register your models
4. Auto-generate your content API

## Conclusion

Code-first content modeling represents the natural evolution of content management for development teams. By bringing content modeling into the developer workflow, Scalar enables more robust, type-safe, and maintainable content structures that can evolve alongside your application.
