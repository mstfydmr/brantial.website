## Designing a CMS developers actually want to use

A deep dive into our design philosophy at Scalar - from intuitive APIs to a clean UI that feels like part of your stack.

## Why most CMS interfaces miss the mark

We've all been there. You're building a website or application and need a content management system. You evaluate the options, pick one that seems promising, and then the frustration begins:

- Overly complex admin interfaces that editors struggle to navigate
- Developer experiences that feel like they're from another era
- APIs that require extensive documentation to understand
- Integration patterns that fight against your preferred stack
- Extension systems that are either too limiting or too complex

After years of experiencing these frustrations firsthand, we started to wonder: **why isn't there a CMS that developers actually want to use?**

This question became the foundation of Scalar's design philosophy.

## Developer experience as the north star

When we started designing Scalar, we established a clear set of principles that would guide our decisions:

### 1. Code-first, visual-optional

Developers should be able to define content models in code using familiar patterns. Visual tools should enhance, not replace, the code experience.

```typescript
// This is how content modeling should feel
const Author = defineType({
  name: 'author',
  fields: {
    name: fields.text({ required: true }),
    bio: fields.richText(),
    avatar: fields.image({ aspectRatio: 1 }),
    socialLinks: fields.object({
      twitter: fields.url(),
      github: fields.url(),
      website: fields.url(),
    }),
  },
});
```

### 2. Your stack, your rules

A CMS should adapt to your development workflow, not the other way around. Scalar is designed to:

- Work with any frontend framework
- Support multiple data storage backends
- Integrate with your existing auth systems
- Deploy anywhere (serverless, containers, VMs)
- Version control content alongside code if desired

### 3. Minimal API surface

APIs should be intuitive enough that you rarely need to check documentation. We obsess over naming, consistency, and predictability.

```typescript
// Our APIs aim for this level of clarity
const posts = await scalar
  .query('post')
  .where({ category: 'engineering' })
  .orderBy({ publishDate: 'desc' })
  .limit(10)
  .include(['author', 'relatedPosts'])
  .exec();
```

### 4. Progressive disclosure

Simple tasks should be simple. Complex tasks should be possible. We use progressive disclosure to maintain this balance:

- Core APIs cover 80% of use cases with minimal complexity
- Extension points reveal power when needed
- Advanced features don't clutter the basic experience

### 5. Performance by default

Performance shouldn't be an afterthought or a premium feature. Scalar is built for speed from the ground up:

- Optimized query execution
- Efficient caching at multiple levels
- Assets optimized automatically
- Server and client performance monitoring

## Understanding developer pain points

To create a better CMS, we needed to deeply understand what frustrates developers about existing solutions. We conducted extensive research, including:

- Interviews with 100+ developers across different experience levels
- Analysis of GitHub issues in popular CMS repositories
- Surveys of developer satisfaction with existing CMS tools
- User testing of early Scalar prototypes

Several key pain points emerged consistently:

### Content modeling limitations

Many CMS platforms either impose rigid structures or offer too little guidance, leading to suboptimal content models.

Our solution:

- Flexible type system with sensible defaults
- Clear patterns for common modeling needs
- Rich relationship types with referential integrity
- Schema validation with helpful error messages

### API inconsistency

Developers described the cognitive load of working with inconsistent, poorly designed APIs as a major pain point.

Our solution:

- Consistent API patterns across all interfaces
- Predictable naming conventions
- Type-safe client libraries
- Clear documentation with plenty of examples

### Deployment complexity

Setting up and maintaining CMS infrastructure shouldn't be a project in itself.

Our solution:

- Single-command deployment options
- Infrastructure as code templates
- Clear separation of concerns
- Containerized architecture

### Poor editor experiences

Developers often have to apologize to content teams for the clunky interfaces they're forced to use.

Our solution:

- Clean, minimalist UI design
- Context-aware editing experiences
- Customizable workflows
- Performance optimizations for editor tasks

## Balancing developer and editor needs

One of the most difficult challenges in CMS design is balancing the needs of developers and content editors. Too often, platforms prioritize one at the expense of the other.

At Scalar, we believe this is a false dichotomy. By understanding the true needs of both groups, we can design experiences that work well for everyone.

### Content modeling that serves both audiences

Scalar's content modeling approach separates structure (developer concern) from presentation (editor concern):

```typescript
// Structure defined by developers
const ProductModel = defineType({
  name: 'product',
  fields: {
    name: fields.text({ required: true }),
    price: fields.number({
      required: true,
      validation: { min: 0 },
    }),
    description: fields.richText(),
    // ...other fields
  },
});

// Presentation configured separately
configureEditingExperience({
  type: 'product',
  groups: [
    {
      name: 'Basic Info',
      fields: ['name', 'price', 'category'],
    },
    {
      name: 'Details',
      fields: ['description', 'specifications', 'images'],
    },
    {
      name: 'SEO & Marketing',
      fields: ['seoTitle', 'seoDescription', 'promoText'],
    },
  ],
});
```

This separation allows:

- Developers to focus on data integrity and structure
- Editors to work in a well-organized interface
- Both sides to collaborate on optimal workflows

### Schema-driven UI

Scalar automatically generates editing interfaces from your content models, but gives you control where it matters:

- Field types determine appropriate input components
- Validation rules create inline validation
- Field metadata configures options and behaviors
- Custom field types for specialized needs

## Real-world examples

Let's look at how our design philosophy translates to real-world developer experiences:

### Case Study: Blog Migration

A development team was migrating from a legacy CMS to Scalar. Their experience highlighted several positive outcomes:

1. **Content modeling clarity**  
   "Defining our content models in TypeScript made the structure explicit in a way our previous CMS never did. We uncovered and fixed several data inconsistencies during the migration."

2. **Migration ease**  
   "The migration CLI helped us map our old content to the new models, and the validation tools caught issues early."

3. **Frontend integration**  
   "Our React components connect directly to Scalar's hooks, which reduced the amount of data fetching code we needed to write by around 70%."

4. **Editor satisfaction**  
   "Our content team reported that the new editing experience was significantly faster and more intuitive."

### Case Study: E-commerce Product Catalog

An e-commerce developer shared their experience implementing a product catalog:

1. **Flexible content modeling**  
   "We needed to support products with drastically different attribute sets. Scalar's union types and conditional fields made this straightforward."

2. **Performance at scale**  
   "With over 50,000 products, query performance was a concern. Scalar's automatic indexing and query optimization kept things fast without manual tuning."

3. **Custom field types**  
   "Creating custom field types for product-specific attributes like size charts and color swatches took less than a day."

4. **Integration with existing systems**  
   "The webhook system made it easy to keep our inventory management system in sync with the CMS."

## The road ahead

While we've made progress on creating a CMS developers actually want to use, our work is far from complete. Our roadmap is guided by ongoing developer feedback:

### Near-term improvements

- Enhanced TypeScript inference for even better type safety
- More granular permissions and role definitions
- Expanded integrations with development tools
- Performance improvements for extremely large datasets

### Longer-term vision

- AI-assisted content modeling and optimization
- Enhanced collaboration tools for development teams
- More powerful visual customization options
- Community plugin marketplace

## Conclusion

Designing a CMS that developers actually want to use requires a deep understanding of developer workflows, pain points, and mental models. At Scalar, we've made this understanding the foundation of our design philosophy.

By prioritizing code-first workflows, consistent APIs, flexible integration patterns, and performance, we're building a CMS that feels like a natural extension of your development stack rather than a separate system to fight against.

We believe that when developers enjoy working with a CMS, it leads to better content models, more efficient workflows, and ultimately better experiences for content creators and end users alike.
