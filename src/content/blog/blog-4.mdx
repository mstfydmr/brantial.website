## Introducing Scalar Cloud

We are launching Scalar Cloud - everything you love about Scalar, now hosted with autoscale, team features, and zero setup.

## A Major Milestone

Today marks a significant evolution in Scalar's journey. After more than a year of development and extensive beta testing with select customers, we're thrilled to announce the general availability of **Scalar Cloud**.

Scalar Cloud brings the power of our headless CMS to a fully-managed, cloud-native environment with enhanced security, reliability, and collaboration features.

## Why Scalar Cloud?

While our open-source version continues to power thousands of websites and applications worldwide, we heard consistent feedback from enterprise customers and growing teams:

> "We love Scalar's developer experience and content modeling, but we need more robust scaling, security, and team features without having to manage the infrastructure ourselves."

Scalar Cloud is our answer to these needs.
