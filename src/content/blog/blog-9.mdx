## Open Source at the core of Scalar

Why we chose to open source Scalar, how we think about sustainability, and how you can get involved.

## Our Open Source Philosophy

From day one, we knew Scalar would be an open source project. This wasn't just a marketing decision or a philosophical stance—it was fundamental to our vision for what a modern content management system should be.

We believe that content infrastructure is too important to be locked behind proprietary walls. Organizations need to own their content model, understand how their data is structured, and have the freedom to evolve their tech stack without vendor lock-in.

This post explains our approach to open source, how we balance community and commercial interests, and how you can contribute to Scalar's future.

## Why We Chose Open Source

Our decision to make Scalar open source was driven by several key factors:

### 1. Developer Trust

Developers rightfully hesitate to build on black boxes. Open source creates trust through transparency—you can see exactly what you're building on, how it works, and even modify it if needed.

### 2. Community Innovation

No single company can match the creativity and diverse use cases of a vibrant community. Some of Scalar's most valuable features came from community contributions addressing real-world problems we hadn't encountered.

### 3. Long-term Viability

Open source provides an "insurance policy" for users. Even if our company changed direction, the core technology would remain available to the community. This stability is crucial for organizations building mission-critical systems.

### 4. Educational Value

Open source code serves as a living educational resource. Many developers have told us they learned about content modeling, TypeScript, or API design by exploring Scalar's codebase.

## Our Open Source Model

Scalar follows a "open core" model, with different components under different licenses:

### MIT Licensed Components

The core Scalar engine, including:

- Content type definition system
- Schema validation
- API generation framework
- Command line interface
- Core plugins

### Commercial Components

Some enterprise-focused features remain proprietary:

- Team collaboration tools
- Enterprise authentication integrations
- Enhanced security features
- White-label customization

This model allows us to balance openness with building a sustainable business that can continue investing in Scalar's development.

## Governance Structure

Transparency extends to our governance process as well:

### RFC Process

Significant changes to Scalar begin as Request for Comments (RFC) documents, which are:

1. Published publicly for community review
2. Open for comments for at least two weeks
3. Reviewed by core maintainers
4. Either accepted, rejected, or sent back for revision

This process ensures major decisions benefit from community input while maintaining a clear direction.

### Maintainer Team

Our maintainer team includes both Scalar employees and community contributors. Maintainers have authority to:

- Review and merge pull requests
- Participate in RFC discussions
- Handle issue triage
- Guide community discussions

We're actively working to increase the diversity of our maintainer team, both in terms of backgrounds and organizations represented.

## Building a Sustainable Project

Open source needs sustainable funding to thrive long-term. Our approach includes:

### Cloud Services

Scalar Cloud provides hosted, managed Scalar instances with additional features. Revenue from this service directly funds open source development.

### Enterprise Support

Organizations that need guaranteed support, custom features, or compliance assistance can purchase enterprise support packages.

### Development Partnerships

For organizations with specific needs, we offer development partnerships where we build features they need, which then become available to the broader community.

### Transparent Allocation

We commit to reinvesting at least 30% of our revenue into open source development, community resources, and documentation.

## Community Contributions

We've been humbled by the quality and quantity of community contributions to Scalar. Contributors have:

- Fixed bugs and improved performance
- Added support for new database backends
- Created integrations with other tools
- Translated documentation
- Developed educational content

We express our gratitude not just with words, but through:

- Highlighting contributors in our release notes
- Featuring community projects in our showcase
- Providing direct mentorship for regular contributors
- Offering special perks like conference tickets and early feature access
